# **Python code style**

* If available, use cell mode (e.g. Jupyter notebooks, Matlab Live Script) to build your code step by step. Proceed to the next step after the current cell is producing the desired outcome.

* Add one to three sentences at the beginning of any function or script describing the purpose of the code. Provide references to websites, books, or research manuscripts

* Use descriptive variable names. For instance: air_temperature instead of T. Exceptions may apply when coding equations from a specific source. In that case, document the page number and/or equation number as a comment next to each line of code.

* Write descriptive variable names using underscores (e.g. air_temperature) or camel case (e.g. airTemperature). Adopt one or the other and be consistent.

* Constants and matrices are usually denoted using upper case letters (e.g. PI, LAMBDA)

* Function names should be all lower case with no underscores (e.g. thermaltime())

* Module names should be all lower case

* Add a space before and after equal, plus, and minus signs to improve readability (e.g. a = 2 + 3)

* Add units as a comment when defining constants, input variables, and output variables
