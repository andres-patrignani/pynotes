## Dreyfus scale of skill acquisition:

Novice | Competent | Proficient | Expert | Mastery

This course aims at make you a **competent/proficient** programmer, meaning that you will be able to automate tasks, analyze datasets, and create a reproducible and logical blueprints of scientific claims.

## Introductions

* Full name
* Degree
* Research topic
* Why are you enrolled in this class?
* Windows/Mac/Linux Operating System

## Programming stats

* Computing occupations are the number 1 source of all new wages in the U.S. 
* Computing occupations make up over half of all projected new jobs in STEM fields.
* Kansas currently has 2,313 open computing jobs
* Kansas had only 338 computer science graduates in 2015; only 14% were female.
* The average salary for a computing occupation in KS is 77,116, higher than average salary in the state (44,570).

## Role of coding in my career

* One of the most important skills that I learned in gradaute school
* Before coding I was confined into analysis of variance and significant differences. 
* Coding enabled spatio-temporal analysis, numerical simulation of physically-based processes, curve fitting and parameter optimization
* Coding forced me to think logically, break down a large problem into smaller steps, and increase attention to seemingly irrelevant details
* Track the work and reasoning of students and colleagues. Underrated tool for advising
* Create something out of thin air

## Brief history of coding languages in Science

Timeline of programming languages. [Source](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_programming_languages)

    * 1958 - Fortran II
    * 1964 - BASIC (Soil Physics with Basic by G. Campbell.
    * 1970 - Pascal
    * 1972 - C (Low level, base of other languages: C++,Java,JavaScript,C#,PHP, Python)
    * 1976 - SAS
    * 1978 - Matlab (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
    * 1989 - Python (https://www.python.org/)
    * 1990 - HTML (physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, used for documentation)
    * 1993 - R (https://www.r-project.org/)
    * 1995 - Java, PHP, Javascript, Ruby
    * 2012 - Julia (https://julialang.org/)

## Why Python?

* Multi-purpose language (analyze data, create software, websites)
* Most popular language in science, large community, lots of online resources
* Free
* Syntax somewhat similar to that of Matlab (at least in packages like Numpy and Scipy)

## Reading assignment

* Read paper by Philip Guo 2013
* Read paper by Sandve et al 2013
