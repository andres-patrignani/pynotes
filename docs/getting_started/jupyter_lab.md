- Code lives in cells, which help organizing your code. The main advantage of cells is that you can run (i.e. execute code) cells individually to ensure that the code is working properly before you move forward.

- To run code in a cell press: `ctrl + enter` keys. The result will appear right below the code.

- To run code in a cell and move onto the next cell when done press: `ctrl + shift + enter` keys
