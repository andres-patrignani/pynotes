# Installating packages

For this class you will need to install the Anaconda package, Git, and create an account in Github. We will write code using the web browser, so I recommend having Google Chrome installed.

## Anaconda Package

We will use the Anaconda environment, which is a set of curated python packages commonly used in science and engineering. The Anaconda environment is available for free by Continuum Analytics. The latest Anaconda package already has Python 3.7.

### Step 1: Download the anaconda installer

* If you have a windows machine go to: <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows>
* If you have a mac go to: <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos>

### Step 2: Install Anaconda

* Double click on the installer and follow the steps. When asked, I highly suggest installing VS Code, which is a powerful editor with autocomplition, debugging capabilities, etc.

### Step 3: Open Anaconda Navigator

* In Windows go to the start up menu in the bottom left corner of the screen and then click on the Anaconda Navigator.

* In Macs go to Applications and double click on the Anaconda Navigator. Alternatively you can use the search bars (in Mac press Command + Space bar).

* **JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook**: We will write most of our code using notebooks, which are ideal for reproducible research.

* **VS Code**: A powerful and modern code editor. You can download it and code here if you want.

* **Spyder**: An integrated development environment for scientific coding in Python. It features a graphical user interface similar to that of Matlab.

## Git

**What is Git?**

* Git is a version control system that tracks changes.

**How do I get started with Git?**

*If you have a mac, you most likely already have Git installed

1. Go to: https://git-scm.com
2. Select Windows/MacOS
3. Follow the installer and use default intallation settings
4. We will most use the command window (called Git Bash), but we need it in order to work with Github.

## Github

**What is Github?**

* Github is a web platform built around Git and has disrupted the software industry.

* In addition to Github there are other similar platforms such as Bitbucket and GitLab, each of them with a different business model.

**How do I get started with Github?**

1. Create a Github account at: https://github.com/
2. Create a repository. Make sure to add a **README** file.
3. Go to your computer and open the terminal
4. Navigate to a directory where you want to place the repository
5. Clone the Github repository using: git clone `<link>`
